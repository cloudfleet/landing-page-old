        <div class="col-md-12">
            <h3>why should I use cloud|fleet?</h3>

            <p>Because with cloud|fleet you can have all the convenience of a cloud service while retaining your privacy</p>

            <p>Because your data should be yours. Don't let the NSA or Google snoop on you.</p>

            <p>The cloud|fleet box with your data is at your home. That means to get to your data people can't simply give a
                secret order to Google to turn it over.</p>

            <p>Because cloud|fleet can grow with your needs. When you need more space, you can just attach an external
                harddrive.</p>


            <h3>can I try out cloud|fleet?</h3>

            <p>You will be able to try out cloud|fleet on a box that is located with us for a week. If you like it you will
                be able to
                transfer your data to the device.</p>

            <h3>will you use free software?</h3>

            <p>Most of the software will be licensed under the AGPL license. We will not use any closed source software.<br>
                Everything we develop on our own will be published on github.</p>

            <h3>will cloud fleet run on X?</h3>

            <p>While we will not give any guarantees everything should be adaptable for your system.<br>
                We will be happy to help people out with any porting endeavours.</p>

            <h3>Can I share the box?</h3>Yes. But we recommend to have your own. The administrator of the box will always have
            access
            to all the data in the box. So if you really want to be the captain of your own data, get your box.

            <h3>how will you make money?</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>We will get off the ground with a crowd funding campaign</li>

                <li>We will sell readily imaged devices</li>

                <li>We will also charge a monthly fee for the firewall tunnelling service and the regular security and
                    feature
                    updates.
                </li>

                <li>We will offer additional services like backup and insurance in case your box breaks down</li>

    <div id="motivation">
        <h2>Motivation</h2>

        <h3>1. Privacy</h3>

        <p>Recent developments showed that big providers cannot be trusted to be able to
            keep
            your data secure, even if they have the best intentions to do no evil.</p>

        <h3>2. Accessability</h3>

        <p>Big providers can shut you out of your account for no reason whatsoever, taking your data with them. Only by
            reclaiming the cloud can you guarantee access to your own data forever.</p>

        <h3>3. Resilience</h3>

        <p>With a big network of inexpensive boxes, no single outtage can have a devastating effect like the shutdown of
            a big provider </p>

        <h3>4. Expandability</h3>

        <p>If you own your data you can augment your cloud with additional as they get available.</p>

        <h2>Architecture</h2>

        <h3>Hardware</h3>

        <p>The cloud|fleet stack will run on any hardware. It will be optimized for the CuBox Pro of SolidRun.</p>

        <h3>Software</h3>

        <h4>Base System</h4>

        <p>The base system will be a hardened version of Ubuntu that exposes a minimal attack interface.</p>

        <h4>Firewall Tunneling</h4>

        <p>To make deployment behind firewalls possible, the cloud|fleet box will connect to a <a href=
                                                                                                          "https://pagekite.net">pagekite</a>
            server.<br>
            Later it will be possible for nodes with a public ip to act as pagekite providers themselves to decentralize
            this
            component.</p>

        <p>A separate system will be used for exposing the mail server.</p>
