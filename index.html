<h2>Motivation</h2>

<h3>1. Privacy</h3>

<p>Recent developments <a href="Prism%20link">1</a> showed that big providers cannot be trusted to be able to keep your data secure, even if they have the best intentions to do no evil.</p>

<h3>2. Accessability</h3>

<p>Big providers can shut you out of your account for no reason whatsoever, taking your data with them. Only by reclaiming the cloud can you guarantee access to your  own data forever.</p>

<h3>3. Resilience</h3>

<p>With a big network of inexpensive boxes, no single outtage can have a devastating effect like the shutdown of a big provider <a href="megaupload%20story">2</a></p>

<h3>4. Expandability</h3>

<p>If you own your data you can augment your cloud with additional as they get available.</p>

<h2>Architecture</h2>

<h3>Hardware</h3>

<p>The cloud|fleet stack will run on any hardware. It will be optimized for the CuBox Pro of SolidRun.</p>

<h3>Software</h3>

<h4>Base System</h4>

<p>The base system will be a hardened version of Ubuntu that exposes a minimal attack interface.</p>

<h4>Firewall Tunneling</h4>

<p>To make deployment behind firewalls possible, the cloud|fleet box will connect to a <a href="https://pagekite.net">pagekite</a> server.<br>
Later it will be possible for nodes with a public ip to act as pagekite providers themselves to decentralize this component.</p>

<p>A separate system will be used for exposing the mail server.</p>
